Title,Six Month Forecast: The Emperor Has Few Clothes
Text,"**The stock forecasting models behind this blog continuously crunch and re-crunch numbers...** The models have some worries, but overall they are not highly concerned about US stock market performance for the coming half year.

**The ""MAGA Bubble"" Risk:**
The MAGA bubble may be imploding. ""Sell America"" is a very real factor. Trump Media (DJT) has lost 88% of its value... This just might fit a pattern of previous ventures. Today, the primary investors and creditors of Donald Trump are the citizens of the United States. With high spending deficits, he is destroying the financial status of the Country.

**Crypto & Commodities:**
One of the largest economic bubbles that may be ready to pop is cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has lost nearly half of its value since last summer. Gold and silver have been rising exponentially and may have peaked. When fear and greed lead to flying prices, crashing prices often follow.

**Valuation Check:**
Stock market valuations are extremely high. Mark Hulbert points to a possible -5.4% yearly loss for the next decade. My own models are less dire, but short-term prices have more room to fall than rise.

**The Crash Catalyst:**
It is hard to generate a stock market crash. A huge number of ""buy and hold"" investors need to get scared enough to sell. As long as high deficit spending and AI infrastructure creation remain, the economy will plod on. However, the situation appears primed for a sudden shock akin to 1987 or 1998. Some small market tremors would be a blessing."
