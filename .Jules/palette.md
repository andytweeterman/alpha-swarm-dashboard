## 2026-02-06 - Semantic Color Contrast
**Learning:** Standard semantic colors (Warning Yellow, Caution Orange) often fail contrast ratios with white text. This is a common pattern in dashboard status indicators.
**Action:** Default to black text for lighter semantic colors (Yellow, Orange, Cyan, Lime) or verify contrast ratios > 4.5:1.
