# Alpha Swarm: User Guide for Investors

Welcome to the Alpha Swarm dashboard. This tool is designed to provide Family Office managers and investors with a clear, high-level view of market risks and opportunities, combining rigorous quantitative analysis with experienced strategic oversight.

## 1. Market Swarm: Projected Volatility
The **Market Swarm** tab provides a visual overview of market trends and projected movements.

- **The Purple Cone**: You will see a fan chart projecting forward from the current price. This 'Purple Cone' represents the **projected volatility range for the next 30 days**. It helps visualize the expected boundaries of price movement based on current market energy, allowing you to gauge potential upside and downside risk over the coming month.

## 2. Risk Governance: Automated Signal System
This section acts as an automated risk manager, monitoring systemic health and triggering alerts when conditions deteriorate.

- **Level 5 (Caution)**: A signal indicating market divergence or elevated risk. It serves as a warning to review portfolio exposure and prepare for potential volatility.
- **Level 7 (Hard Sell)**: This is a critical signal triggered specifically by **Credit Spreads** (stress in bond markets). It is interpreted as a **hard sell** instruction to preserve capital, signaling that structural risks have reached a point where defensive action is mandatory.

## 3. Strategist View: The Human Overlay
While the first two tabs are purely quantitative (driven by mathematical models), the **Strategist View** provides the **human overlay**.

- **Human Insight**: This tab offers the Chief Strategist's interpretation of the quantitative data, providing context, narrative, and forward-looking analysis that pure data cannot capture. It bridges the gap between raw numbers and actionable investment strategy.
